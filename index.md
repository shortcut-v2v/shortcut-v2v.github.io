Video-to-video translation aims to generate video frames of a target domain from an input video.
Despite its usefulness, the existing video-to-video translation methods require enormous computations, necessitating their model compression for wide use.
While there exist compression methods that improve computational efficiency in various image/video tasks, a generally-applicable compression method for video-to-video translation has not been studied much.
In response, this paper presents Shortcut-V2V, a general-purpose compression framework for video-to-video translation.
Shortcut-V2V avoids full inference for every neighboring video frame by approximating the intermediate features of a current frame from those of the preceding frame.
Moreover, in our framework, a newly-proposed block called AdaBD adaptively blends and deforms features of neighboring frames, which makes more accurate predictions of the intermediate features possible.
We conduct quantitative and qualitative evaluations using well-known video-to-video translation models on various tasks to demonstrate the general applicability of our framework.
The results show that Shoutcut-V2V achieves comparable performance compared to the original video-to-video translation model while saving 3.2-5.7x computational cost and 7.8-44x memory at test time.

*Overview of the proposed ShortCutV2V. (a) is an overall architecture of Shorcut-V2V, and (b) shows a detailed architecture of Shortcut block. &uarr and &darr refer to upsampling and downsampling by a factor of 2. Here, `offset G' indicates an offset generator.*

In this paper, we propose Shortcut-V2V, a general compression framework to improve the test-time efficiency in video-to-video translation.
A video-to-video translation network translates input video frames $\{\mathbf{I}_{t}\}_{t=1}^{N_T}$ into output frames $\{\mathbf{O}_{t}\}_{t=1}^{N_T}$ of a target domain, where $N_T$ indicates the number of frames in a video.
To avoid temporal redundancy in computations for adjacent frames, Shortcut block approximates the intermediate features $\hat{\mathbf{f}}_{t+i}$ at a current timestep $t+i$ from a decoding layer $l_d \in [N_L - N_d + 1, N_L]$ of a teacher model $T$, where $\mathbf{f}_{t+i} = T_{[1,l_d]}(\mathbf{I}_{t+i})$ and $N_L$ and $N_d$ denotes the number of layers in the teacher model $T$ and only in the decoder, respectively.

Our block leverages the previous frame features $\mathbf{f}_{t}$ and $\mathbf{a}_{t}$, as well as the same timestep's features $\mathbf{a}_{t+i}$, where $\mathbf{a}_{t}$ and $\mathbf{a}_{t+i}$ are extracted from an encoding layer $l_e \in [1, N_e]$. $N_e$ indicates the number of layers in the encoder of a teacher model.
Here, the previous features $\mathbf{f}_{t}$ allow our model to lightly approximate $\hat{\mathbf{f}}_{t+i}$ by providing similar features while the current frame features $\mathbf{a}_{t+i}$ support synthesis of newly-appeared areas in the current frame.
To exploit both features, we first globally align previous features. 
Then, \ourblock simultaneously performs local alignment of the previous features and adaptive blending with the current features.
Finally, $\mathbf{\hat{f}}_{t+i}$ pass through the following layers in the teacher model to synthesize the final output $\mathbf{\hat{O}}_{t+i} = T_{[l_d+1,N_L]}(\mathbf{\hat{f}}_{t+i})$. 

## Objective
Turing's main objective in this paper was to investigate the notion of computability and its relation to the Entscheidungsproblem (the decision problem), which is concerned with determining whether a given mathematical statement is provable or not.


## Key Ideas
1. Turing first presented the concept of a "computable number," which refers to a number that can be computed by an algorithm or a definite step-by-step process.
2. He introduced the notion of a Turing machine, an abstract computational device consisting of an infinite tape divided into cells and a read-write head. The machine can read and write symbols on the tape, move the head left or right, and transition between states based on a set of rules.
3. Turing demonstrated that the set of computable numbers is enumerable, meaning it can be listed in a systematic way, even though it is not necessarily countable.
4. He proved the existence of non-computable numbers, which cannot be computed by any Turing machine.
5. Turing showed that the Entscheidungsproblem is undecidable, meaning there is no algorithm that can determine, for any given mathematical statement, whether it is provable or not.

## Table: Comparison of Computable and Non-Computable Numbers

| Computable Numbers | Non-Computable Numbers |
|-------------------|-----------------------|
| Rational numbers, e.g., 1/2, 3/4 | Transcendental numbers, e.g., π, e |
| Algebraic numbers, e.g., √2, ∛3 | Non-algebraic numbers, e.g., √2 + √3 |
| Numbers with finite decimal representations | Numbers with infinite, non-repeating decimal representations |

He used the concept of a universal Turing machine to prove that the set of computable functions is recursively enumerable, meaning it can be listed by an algorithm.

## Significance
Turing's paper laid the foundation for the theory of computation and had a profound impact on the development of computer science. The Turing machine became a fundamental concept in theoretical computer science, serving as a theoretical model for studying the limits and capabilities of computation. Turing's work also influenced the development of programming languages, algorithms, and the design of modern computers.
