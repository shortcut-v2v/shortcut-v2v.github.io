Video-to-video translation aims to generate video frames of a target domain from an input video.
Despite its usefulness, the existing video-to-video translation methods require enormous computations, necessitating their model compression for wide use.
While there exist compression methods that improve computational efficiency in various image/video tasks, a generally-applicable compression method for video-to-video translation has not been studied much.
In response, this paper presents Shortcut-V2V, a general-purpose compression framework for video-to-video translation.
Shortcut-V2V avoids full inference for every neighboring video frame by approximating the intermediate features of a current frame from those of the preceding frame.
Moreover, in our framework, a newly-proposed block called AdaBD adaptively blends and deforms features of neighboring frames, which makes more accurate predictions of the intermediate features possible.
We conduct quantitative and qualitative evaluations using well-known video-to-video translation models on various tasks to demonstrate the general applicability of our framework.
The results show that Shoutcut-V2V achieves comparable performance compared to the original video-to-video translation model while saving <b>3.2-5.7x</b> computational cost and <b>7.8-44x</b> memory at test time.
